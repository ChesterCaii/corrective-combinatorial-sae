### Current Limitations (CPU-only simulation):
1. **Model**: Using GPT-2-medium (355M) instead of Gemma-2-2B (2B params)
2. **SAE Features**: Mock/synthetic SAEs instead of real GemmaScope
3. **Text Generation**: Simulated steering via prompt modification
4. **Scale**: Limited to smaller datasets due to CPU constraints

## WHAT NEEDS GPU FOR REAL VALIDATION

### Real Implementation Requirements:
1. **Actual Gemma-2-2B model** (requires 8-24GB VRAM)
2. **Real GemmaScope SAEs** from Google Research
3. **Large-scale processing** (1M+ tokens)
4. **True activation steering** (not prompt simulation)

### Infrastructure Options:
- **RunPod RTX 4090**: $0.44/hr, 24GB VRAM (recommended)
- **RunPod RTX 3060**: $0.20/hr, 12GB VRAM (budget option)
- **Google Colab Pro**: $10/month, T4/V100 access
- **Estimated validation cost**: $2-5 for complete real-data validation

## PROJECT IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Current Achievement Level: **PROOF OF CONCEPT**
