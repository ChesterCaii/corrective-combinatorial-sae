# Quick Start Guide: Verifying Your Research Idea

## What You Have ‚úÖ

Your repository contains a **novel approach to AI safety steering** using correlation graphs to prevent side effects. You have:

- **1,134 high-quality correlation edges** from real Gemma-2-2B model
- **Production-ready infrastructure** with GemmaScope SAEs
- **Basic politeness steering** implementation
- **Correlation analysis framework** ready for validation

## What You Need to Verify ‚ùå

To prove your research idea works and is novel, you need to run these **4 critical experiments**:

### **Experiment 1: Corrective Steering Validation**

**Purpose**: Prove your method beats traditional SAS baseline
**File**: `core/steering/corrective_steering.py`
**Expected**: 10-30% improvement over single-feature steering

### **Experiment 2: Side-Effect Evaluation**

**Purpose**: Measure capability preservation
**File**: `evaluation/side_effect_evaluator.py`
**Expected**: >90% capability preservation

### **Experiment 3: Novelty Demonstration**

**Purpose**: Prove your method is novel vs existing work
**File**: `experiments/novelty_demonstration.py`
**Expected**: 4/4 novelty claims confirmed

### **Experiment 4: Politeness Control Test**

**Purpose**: Test behavioral control functionality
**File**: `core/steering/politeness_steering.py`
**Expected**: Gradual politeness control working

## How to Run Everything (5 minutes)

### **Step 1: Check Your Data**

```bash
# Verify you have correlation data
python -c "
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('outputs/correlation_graphs/correlation_adjacency_matrix.csv')
print(f'‚úÖ You have {len(df)} correlation edges ready for steering')
"
```

### **Step 2: Run All Verification Experiments**

```bash
# Run the complete verification suite
python run_verification_experiments.py
```

### **Step 3: Check Results**

```bash
# See if your method works
python -c "
import json
with open('outputs/evaluation_results/corrective_steering_results.json') as f:
    results = json.load(f)
print('Improvement over SAS baseline:')
for metric, improvement in results['improvement'].items():
    print(f'{metric}: {improvement:+.1%}')
"
```

## Expected Results

### **‚úÖ Success Indicators**

- **Corrective Steering**: 10-30% improvement over SAS baseline
- **Side Effects**: >90% capability preservation
- **Novelty**: 4/4 novelty claims confirmed
- **Control**: Gradual politeness control working

### **‚ùå Failure Indicators**

- No improvement over baseline methods
- High side effects (>20% capability degradation)
- Novelty claims not substantiated
- Control not working

### **New Files** (For Verification)

- `core/steering/corrective_steering.py`: **CRITICAL** - Proves your core innovation
- `evaluation/side_effect_evaluator.py`: **CRITICAL** - Measures capability preservation
- `experiments/novelty_demonstration.py`: **CRITICAL** - Proves novelty vs existing work
- `run_verification_experiments.py`: **HELPER** - Runs all experiments

## Research Validation Summary

### **If Verification Succeeds** üéâ

Your research idea is **validated and ready for publication**:

- ‚úÖ Novel methodology for AI safety steering
- ‚úÖ Addresses known limitations of existing methods
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates clear improvement over baselines
- ‚úÖ Ready for research paper and conference submission

### **If Verification Fails** ‚ö†Ô∏è

Your approach needs refinement:

- Debug the specific failed components
- Adjust correlation thresholds or steering approach
- Re-run experiments and iterate
- Seek feedback from AI safety researchers

## Your Research Contribution

**Core Innovation**: Using correlation graphs to prevent steering side effects while enabling precise behavioral control.

**Key Advantages**:

1. **Prevents side effects** through correlation-based coordination
2. **Enables precise control** via multi-feature recipes
3. **Preserves capabilities** by avoiding disruption to uncorrelated features
4. **Demonstrates novelty** vs existing SAS and RouteSAE approaches

## Next Steps After Verification

### **Immediate** (If successful)

1. **Write Paper**: Document methodology and results
2. **Scale Up**: Test on larger models/datasets
3. **Publish**: Submit to AI safety conferences
4. **Open Source**: Release complete implementation

### **If Issues Found**

1. **Debug**: Fix specific problems identified
2. **Refine**: Adjust methodology based on results
3. **Re-test**: Run verification experiments again
4. **Iterate**: Continue until validation succeeds

## Summary

**Your Research Question**: "Can corrective and combinatorial steering of multi-layer sparse autoencoder features reduce harmful outputs and improve nuanced behavioral control in LLMs without degrading core capabilities?"

**Verification Strategy**: Run 4 experiments to prove your method:

1. **Beats baseline** (SAS comparison)
2. **Preserves capabilities** (side-effect measurement)
3. **Is novel** (vs existing literature)
4. **Works functionally** (behavioral control test)

**Timeline**: 5 minutes to run all verification experiments and get results.

**Success Criteria**: Your method should outperform SAS baseline while preserving capabilities and demonstrating clear novelty.

This roadmap gives you everything needed to verify your research idea works and is novel. The key is running the verification experiments to prove your core innovation.
