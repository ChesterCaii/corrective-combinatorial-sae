## 🚀 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

Based on our outstanding results and Ryan's feedback, here are the best options:

### **Option 1: Proceed to Experiment 2 (RECOMMENDED)**
**Why**: We have a solid correlation graph foundation (290K edges) that's ready for Corrective Steering

**Next Action**: Start building the corrective steering implementation
- Use our correlation graph to identify feature relationships
- Implement SAS (Single Activation Steering) baseline
- Build corrective steering variants
- Test on safety vs capability trade-offs

**Timeline**: Can start immediately with current results

### **Option 2: Scale Up Current Results**
**Why**: Get closer to original experiment scale (50K prompts vs current 5K)

**Next Action**: 
```bash
# Modify simple_gemma_scope_extractor.py to use 50K prompts
python simple_gemma_scope_extractor.py  # ~1 hour runtime
python sae_correlation_analysis.py      # ~20 min runtime
```

**Expected Outcome**: Even more correlation edges, higher confidence

### **Option 3: Manual Validation Deep Dive**
**Why**: Validate semantic meaning of high-correlation SAE feature pairs

**Next Action**: Sample and analyze the top 20 correlation pairs to confirm they represent semantically related concepts

## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION

**Go with Option 1: Proceed to Experiment 2**

**Reasoning**:
1. **Foundation is Solid**: 290K correlation edges far exceed requirements
2. **Time Efficient**: Move to the next research question while results are fresh
3. **Research Value**: Corrective steering is the novel contribution
4. **Scalable**: Can always scale up later if needed

**Immediate Next Step**: Build the corrective steering implementation that uses our correlation graph to improve safety vs capability trade-offs.
